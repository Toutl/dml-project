# Data Modeling Lab Project
---

In this project we will be building two models inspired in data from de SDSS.
One of which will be a regression model and the other a classification one.

In this project, we will build two ML models inspired by data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) as a project for the class of Data Modeling Laboratory.
One will be a regression model, and the other a classification model.

## Regression model
<!-- MAYBE This model focuses on predicting *spectroscopic redshift* from photometric data â€” a task commonly known as *photometric redshift* estimation. -->

<!-- TODO: Explanation -->

## Classification model
This model aims to classify galaxy images according to their morphology.


## Data:
You can download the galaxy images here:
